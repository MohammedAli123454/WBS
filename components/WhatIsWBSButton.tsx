              <strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)</strong> is a core project management tool that organizes all project work into a clear, hierarchical structure. Each level of a WBS divides the project into smaller, more manageable componentsâ€”making complex projects easier to plan, assign, and track.
              <br /><br />
              A well-structured WBS:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
                <li>Defines the complete scope and deliverables</li>
                <li>Breaks work into tasks and subtasks for clarity</li>
                <li>Enables effective scheduling, budgeting, and progress monitoring</li>
                <li>Clarifies team responsibilities and reduces overlap</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              In short, a WBS ensures that all project work is accounted for, helping teams deliver projects efficiently and with greater transparency.
